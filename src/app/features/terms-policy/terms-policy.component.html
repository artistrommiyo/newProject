  <p>
    These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of our platform and services. By registering and using our website, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not proceed with registration or use of our services.
  </p>

  <p>Greetings from MoneyMining.com! We believe that setting out some terms and conditions is necessary before moving, considering the fact there won’t be any in-person meeting.</p>
  <p>In case of any customer-related queries about Money Mining, please do not hesitate to reach us. In this agreement, we shall be referring to the services offered by Money Mining as the "service", to you as the "user", and this arrangement as the "agreement".</p>
  <p>
    Before using our “Common Needs” feature, you declare that you are over 18 years of age and are fully able and qualified to enter into any sort of agreements, provisions, obligations, terms, affirmations, representations, and warranties complying with the making of the documents, and are informed about the same.

  <h2>About MONEY MINING</h2>
  <p>
    MONEY MINING is a network marketing company located in Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India. We facilitate user-to-user addition, referrals, and monetary transactions between users and the company, including earnings from referrals and gameplay activities such as Ludo, Spin, and Rummy, etc.
  </p>
  <p><strong>MONEY MINING ONLY PROVIDES A PLATFORM FOR INTERACTION AND CONSULTATION</strong></p>
  <p>
    MONEY MINING is an online platform that aids conversations between legal practitioners and potential users of legal assistance. MONEY MINING acts as a gateway for service providers and customers of legal services to trade information to ultimately build a professional association. However, MONEY MINING doesn’t guarantee that all users will successfully attain an attorney, advocate, or lawyer through the system. MONEY MINING takes no stand and grants no conclusion on when or if a lawyer-client alliance has been established.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our vision is to provide an optimal forum for lawyers and clients, but MONEY MINING does not involve itself in the agreements between attorneys and clients or the actual representation of clients. Hence, we do not assure the fulfillment of the arrangement or the uprightness of either of the parties. The user, and not MONEY MINING, is wholly liable for evaluating the sincerity, reliability, and trustworthiness of every person with whom the user interacts with this service.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h2>THIRD PARTY CONTENT</h2>
  <p>
    Third-party content may appear on MONEY MINING or may be available via links from MONEY MINING. MONEY MINING is not responsible for and implies no liability for any errors, distortions of law, defamation, libel, slander, exclusions, misrepresentation, vulgarity, or profanity in the statements, ideas, representations, or any other form of information included in any third-party material appearing on MONEY MINING. You understand that the information and opinions in the third-party material are neither endorsed by nor does it reflect the opinion of MONEY MINING.
  </p>

  <h2>UNLAWFUL ACTIVITY</h2>
  <p>
    MONEY MINING reserves the right to investigate charges or reported violations of the Agreement and to take any action MONEY MINING considers appropriate including but not limited to inscribing any speculated outlawed activity to law enforcement officials, regulators, or other third parties and uncovering any information required or appropriate to such persons or entities relating to user profiles, posted materials, IP addresses, e-mail addresses, usage history, and traffic information.
  </p>

  <h2>REMEDIES FOR VIOLATIONS</h2>
  <p>
    MONEY MINING reserves the right to seek all assistance available at law and in equity for infractions of the Agreement, including but not limited to the right to obstruct access from a specific Internet address to MONEY MINING.com and its attributes.
  </p>

  <h2>CONFLICTS CHECKS</h2>
  <p>The user agrees that certified lawyers or user will not be able to and will not perform an investigation for conflicts of interest between the user and other clients of the registered lawyers or user before acknowledging a request. These checks require the user to provide their contact information in detail and the identity of any associated entities, opposing individuals and entities, and such other information as prosecutors may require. Conflict checks by licensed lawyers who obtain data from the user through this service are not possible since submissions by the user to subscribing lawyers or user are insufficient to conduct such a check.</p>

  <h2>SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS</h2>
  <p>The Agreement and the Privacy Policy aggregates the entire agreement with respect to the use of the service provided by MONEY MINING. If any provision of these terms and conditions is outlawed, void, or non-binding then that provision shall be regarded severable from the remaining provisions and shall not affect their efficacy and enforceability.</p>

  <h2>MODIFICATIONS TO TERMS OF USE</h2>
  <p>MONEY MINING reserves the right to change the agreement at any time. The user will be responsible for reviewing the Terms and Conditions before use. The use of the service after the change will symbolize the approval of the new terms and conditions.</p>

  <h2>MODIFICATIONS TO SERVICE</h2>
  <p>MONEY MINING can modify or suspend, provisionally or permanently, the service with or without intimation to the user. The user agrees that MONEY MINING shall not be responsible to the user or any third-party for any alteration or non-continuity of its services. The user accepts and agrees that any termination of service under any stipulation of this agreement may be effected without any prior notice, and recognizes and agrees that MONEY MINING may promptly delete data and files in the user's account and prohibit any further access to such files or the Service.</p>

  <h2>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
  <p>A great risk for MONEY MINING, and for all operators of online systems, is that we might be held responsible for the wrongful activities of our users. If one user defames another user, the harmed user might blame MONEY MINING, even though the first user was really to blame. If a user uploads a data with a network virus, and the other users' processors are damaged, we might be blamed even though a user who transmitted the virus on our system is at fault. If a user transfers illegal or inappropriate information to another user, we might be blamed even though we did nothing more than unknowingly convey the message from one user to another. Accordingly, we need all users to accept the liability for their own actions, and to admit that an act by another user that damages them must not be blamed on us, but only on the other user.</p>

  <p>Although it is the goal of MONEY MINING to provide users with secure and quality systems, we may make errors or encounter system failure from time to time. Such problems are unavoidable in operating a system of this magnitude. We would not be able to make this practice available to users if we had to accept liability or financial liability for any usability intricacies, system failures or errors, or mistakes or damages of any kind. In order to commit continuity of offerings and improving our services, MONEY MINING denies any guarantees on this service and states that our liability for any predicaments connected with the use of our system is strictly limited.</p>

  <h3>Disclaimer of Warranties</h3>
  <p>The user expressly acknowledges that use of the service is at the user's individual risk. The service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. MONEY MINING expressly disclaims all guarantees of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, eligibility for a particular objective, and non-infringement. MONEY MINING does not claim that the service will meet a user's specifications, that the service will be timely, protected, unbroken, or error-free; nor does MONEY MINING make any claim as to the results that may be obtained from the use of the service or as to the exactitude or authenticity of any data obtained through the service or that errors in the software will be adjusted. MONEY MINING does not claim any goods or services or information obtained through the service or any transactions entered into through the service. No information or advice, whether oral or written, obtained by the User from MONEY MINING shall create any warranty not expressly stated herein.</p>

  <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
  <p>The user agrees that MONEY MINING shall not be held responsible for any direct, indirect, accidental, special, or eventful damages resulting from the use or the incapacity to use the service or for the cost of acquisition of alternate goods and services or emerging from any goods or services purchased or obtained or information received or transactions entered into through or from the service or resulting from unapproved access to or modification of user's transmissions or data, including, but not limited to damages for loss of profits, use, data or other intangibles, even if MONEY MINING has been advised of the probability of such damages. The user further agrees that MONEY MINING shall not be liable for any casualties arising from interference, suspension, or termination of services, including, but not limited to direct, indirect, accidental, unusual, eventful, or exemplary losses, whether or not such interruption, suspension or termination was justified, unconcerned, deliberate or accidental.</p>

  <h2>ARBITRATION</h2>
  <p>Any dispute or counterclaim arising out of or associating with this Agreement or with the services of MONEY MINING shall be resolved by forcing Arbitration according to the laws of India. Any such disagreement or claim shall be negotiated on an individual basis, and shall not be incorporated in any compromise with any claim or disagreement of any other party. Any other argument or breach of a legal nature will also be decided in accordance with the laws of India, and the Courts of Indore shall have discretion in all such cases.</p>

MONEY MINING does not sell, license, lease, or otherwise provide any of the materials other than those expressly recognized as being provided by MONEY MINING.

  <h2>ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h2>
  <p>This agreement composes the intact and whole agreement between user and MONEY MINING, and is meant as a comprehensive and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement. This agreement shall supersede all other statements between MONEY MINING and its users with respect to the subject matter about and outmodes and replaces all former or contemporaneous intelligence or agreements, verbal or written, concerning such subject matter.

  <h2>CANCELLATION AND REFUND POLICY</h2>
  <p>We endeavor to ensure that the services you avail through our website are to your complete satisfaction, and are the best in the industry at remarkably reasonable and affordable charges. However, there may arise situations when you desire a refund. Firstly, when you pay for the services but later decide that you do not wish to avail them. Secondly, when there is a lag in the services offered from our side, beyond the time frame we have hinted to you, due to rational error i.e., factors for which we are individually responsible. Thirdly, although we highly doubt it, you might find our services inadequate. In all three situations, kindly send in an email to the Ticket that has been created in your name, marking a copy to contact@MONEY MINING.com . We would like to clarify that only refunds of the expert fees component of the charges paid by you shall be considered for a refund.</p>

  <p>Upon receiving your mail, the Senior Management at MONEY MINING shall decide on whether your request for a refund should be processed, contingent on the reasons for such a request. Please note that we reserve the right to take the final and restraining decisions concerning requests for refunds.</p>

  <p>Most importantly, we wish to elucidate that in cases outside our control, including but not limited to department holidays, delays on the part of the Government of India, national holidays, the respective State Governments, Our affiliates or elsewhere, acts of war, acts of God, earthquake, protest, demolition, labor shortage or conflict, internet suspension, power disturbance, lack of phone network connectivity, mechanical failures, wreckage of sea cable, hacking, forgery, we shall not be held liable for any delays.</p>

  <p>If we confirm your request for a refund, subject to the terms and conditions mentioned herein or elsewhere, we will send you an e-mail asking the details required to compensate the amount which may involve your Bank Account details such as the account number and the IFS code of the branch in question. Please note that it will take us a minimum of about 48-72 working hours from the receipt of all such information to process the refund and initiate the transfer. Also note that we do not provide any refunds for our consultation services after one has received those.</p>

  <p>We reiterate once again that only the professional fees paid for our services shall be refunded, subject to the discretion of the Senior Management at MONEY MINING.com.</p>
